                    <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century 
                        in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that 
                        coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar
                        way to how it is prepared now. (Source: <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#:~:text=The%20earliest%20credible%20evidence%20of%20coffee%2Ddrinking%20or%20knowledge%20of,how%20it%20is%20prepared%20now.">Wikipedia</a></cite>)
